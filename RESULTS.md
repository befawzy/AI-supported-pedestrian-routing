# Modeling Results

 At test time we sample multiple times from the model and chose the best prediction in L2 sense for quantitative evaluation. N refers to the number of time we sample from our model during test time. We report two error metrics Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) for t<sub>pred</sub> = 8 in meters.
